# MIT-Attendance-Calculator

<br>
This is a beginner's github project file
<br>

<br>
The code is completely made using python and 2 other libraries (Pandas, Streamlit)

All contributions are welcome
<br>


There is only one single file to read, i.e. the main python file named streamlit_app.py
<br>

# Libraries : Streamlit, Pandas
# Please don't do unnecessary PR ☠️
